.SYNOPSIS
    Builds a Python application with PyInstaller, moves the EXE to the root directory,
    and runs Inno Setup (ISCC) to package it.

.DESCRIPTION
    - Detects the root and source directories automatically.
    - Runs PyInstaller.
    - Moves the resulting EXE to the root folder.
    - Cleans up build artifacts.
    - Runs ISCC.exe to build an installer.
    - Deletes the standalone EXE only if the installer build succeeds.

.PARAMETER AppName
    The name of your application (used for folder, EXE, icon, and ISS file).
